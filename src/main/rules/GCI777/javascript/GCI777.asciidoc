== Why is this an issue?
 
Avoid imports of known resource-hungry or deprecated libraries and suggest lighter alternatives.

This rule flags any import, require or dynamic import of libraries listed in the project's deprecation dictionary (`moment`, `iconsax`, etc.), because these libraries
1. Inflate your bundle size
2. Slow parsing & compilation
3. Often lack tree-shaking support
4. May be unmaintained

[source,js,data-diff-id="2",data-diff-type="noncompliant"]
----
import moment from "moment";
const age = moment().diff(birthday, "years");
----
 
[source,js,data-diff-id="2",data-diff-type="compliant"]
----
import differenceInYears from "date-fns/differenceInYears";
const age = differenceInYears(new Date(), birthday);
