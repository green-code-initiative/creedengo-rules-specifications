Transmitting a file over a network infrastructure without compressing it consumes more energy than with compression. More precisely, energy efficiency is improved in case the data is compressed at least by 10%, transmitted and decompressed at the other network node. From the Android client side, it means making a post HTTP request using a `GZIPOutputStream` instead of the classical OutputStream, along with the `HttpURLConnection` object.

== Non compliant Code Example

[source,java]
----
Url url = new Url("https://www.green-code-initiative.io/");
HttpsUrlConnection con = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
OutputStream stream = con.getOutputStream();
