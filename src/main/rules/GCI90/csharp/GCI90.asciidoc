Use Cast instead of Select to cast.

== Why is this an issue ?

Cast is more efficient than Select for casting operations, its usage leads to better performance.

=== When can it be ignored ?

This rule shouldn't be ignored.

== Non compliant example

[source, cs]
----
void Test(IEnumerable<string> items)
{
    var asObjects = items.Select(x => (object)x);
}
----

== Compliant example

[source, cs]
----
void Test(IEnumerable<string> items)
{
    var asObjects = items.Cast<object>();
}
