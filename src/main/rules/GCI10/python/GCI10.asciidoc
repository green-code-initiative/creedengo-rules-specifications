SVG images generated by common drawing softwares contains unnecessary data: calc layer, metadata, namespaces and comments.

== Relevance Analysis

The following results were obtained through local experiments.

=== Configuration

* SQLite Database: 5-6 GB
* Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 5 135U, 2100 MHz, 12 cores, 14 logical processors
* RAM: 16 GB
* CO2 Emissions Measurement: Using CodeCarbon

=== Context
 
For example, by using SVGOMG, a tool for optimizing SVGs, we were able to reduce the file size from 22 KB to 11 KB, a 50% reduction. This is useful for page loading or data storage.

=== Test Execution

For this analysis, we simulated a process of manipulating these SVG files. The objective was to measure the impact of file size on CO2 emissions. We used an "optimized" SVG file and a "non-optimized" SVG file. The modification consisted of changing certain parts of the SVG and saving the final result.

=== Impact Analysis

=== Conclusion

The emissions with the non-optimized file are 1.3928360831225074e-08, while the emissions with the optimized file are 9.68571752760373e-09, representing a 30% reduction in emissions.

We recommend incorporating file optimization techniques as part of our standard development practices and exploring additional opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of our digital products.
