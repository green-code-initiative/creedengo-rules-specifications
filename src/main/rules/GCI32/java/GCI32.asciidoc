If you know in advance how many characters would be appended, initialize builder/buffer with the appropriate size.
They will thus never have to be resized.
This saves CPU cycles and therefore consumes less energy.

== Non compliant Code Example

[source,java]
----
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); // Noncompliant
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    sb.append(...);
}
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,java]
----
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(100);
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    sb.append(...);
}
