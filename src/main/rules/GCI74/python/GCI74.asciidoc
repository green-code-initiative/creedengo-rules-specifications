Database servers have to resolve schema fields when using asterisk symbol (`*`). Knowing and using the schema saves CPU cycles and network transfer.

== Non compliant Code Example

[source,python]
----
public void foo() {
    ...
    String baseQuery = "SELECT * FROM users"; // Noncompliant
    ...
}
----

== Compliant Solution

[source,python]
----
public void foo() {
    ...
        String query = "SELECT id, name, address FROM users ";
    ...
}
----

== Configuration

* SQLite database: 5-6 GB
* Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 5 135U, 2100 MHz, 12 cores, 14 logical processors
* RAM: 16 GB
* CO2 Emission measurement: Using https://codecarbon.io/[CodeCarbon]
* Memory usage measurement: Using https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[psutil]

== Impact Analysis

We investigated the correlation between column selection and carbon emissions. 

The query structure used was:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT {selected_cols} FROM my_table WHERE col10 = random_word
----

The WHERE clause was included to increase query complexity and yield more meaningful results. 

We observed carbon emission trends as we manipulated the number of selected columns.

After the first query, carbon emissions decreased slightly due to SQL indexing. Subsequently, emissions remained relatively stable. However, for the last query using `SELECT *`, carbon emissions increased as the query no longer utilized the index.

Similar trends were observed for execution time and memory usage:

== Conclusion

The number of selected columns has a direct impact on:

1. Carbon emissions
2. Execution time
3. Memory usage

Additionally, for security and readability reasons, it's preferable to specify column names rather than using `SELECT *`.

Selecting only necessary columns also results in lighter network traffic.
