# You should not format number with an external library (`@creedengo/no-imported-number-format-library`)

⚠️ This rule _warns_ in the following configs: ✅ `flat/recommended`, ✅ `recommended`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

## Why is this an issue?

Importing an external library for lightweight operations increases overall size of the program.
Using native methods instead reduces the amount of memory and storage to run and store the application.
This is especially critical in environments with limited resources, such as on mobile devices or in web applications
where bandwidth and download times matter.

Smaller programs generally have better runtime performance.
Reducing the number of unnecessary modules minimizes the amount of code that needs to be interpreted or compiled,
leading to faster execution and improved overall performance.

## Examples

**Example with the [numbro](https://numbrojs.com/) library, when you use
`format` method.**

```js
// Example with numbro
import numbro from "numbro";

numbro.setLanguage('en-GB');
var string = numbro(1000).format({
  thousandSeparated: true,
}); // '1,000'

// Example with Intl
new Intl.NumberFormat("en-GB").format(1000); // '1,000'
```
