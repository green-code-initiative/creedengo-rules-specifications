To avoid draining the battery, an iOS device that is left idle quickly falls asleep.

Hence, keeping the screen on should be avoided, unless it is absolutely necessary. If so, developers typically
disable the idle timer with `UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true`.

[source,swift]

UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true
