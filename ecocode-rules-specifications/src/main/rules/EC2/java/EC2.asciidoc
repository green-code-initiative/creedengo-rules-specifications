If we are using too many conditional `if` – `else` statements it will impact performance since JVM will have to compare the conditions. We can think of using a switch statement instead of multiple `if` – `else` if possible. `switch` statement has a performance advantage over `if` – `else`.

## Non-compliant Code Example

```java
int index = 1;
int nb = 2;

if (nb > index) {
    nb = nb + index;
} else {
    nb = nb - 1;
}
if (nb != index + 1) {
    nb = nb + index;
} else {
    nb = nb - 1;
}
```

## Compliant Code Example

```java
int index = 1;
int nb = 2;

if (nb > index) {
    nb = nb + index;
} else {
    nb = nb - 1;
}
```
