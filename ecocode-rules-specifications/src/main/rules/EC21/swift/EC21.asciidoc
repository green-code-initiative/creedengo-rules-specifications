To avoid draining the battery, an iOS device adapt its brightness to the environment.
Hence, keeping forcing the screen brightness on should be avoided, unless it is absolutely necessary.
If so, developers typically force the brightness to 1 with `UIScreen.main.brightness`.

## Non-Compliant Code Example

```swift
UIScreen.main.brightness = 0.3
```
