Return Task directly.

## Why is this an issue ?

Asynchronous methods that contain a single awaited statement can be optimized by removing the `async` modifier and returning the awaited `Task` directly.
Doing so reduces the overhead of the state machine generated for the asynchronous method, leading to more efficient code and improving the resource efficiency of the application.

### When can it be ignored ?

When this rule is applied, the code running inside the method becomes synchronous, which may or may not be desirable.
The decision to do so should be done with consideration to the context in which the method is used.

## Non-compliant example

[source, cs]
----
public static async Task Test()
{
	await Task.Delay(1000); // Non-compliant. Applying the rule is very safe here.
}
----

[source, cs]
----
public static async Task Test()
{
	await MyAsyncMethod(GetParameters()); // Applying the rule depends on GetParameters() here, is it ok to run it synchronously ?
}
----

## Compliant example

[source, cs]
----
public static Task Test()
{
	return Task.Delay(1000); // Compliant
}
----

[source, cs]
----
public static async Test()
{
	return MyAsyncMethod(GetParameters()); // Compliant, but GetParameters() is called synchronously now.
}
