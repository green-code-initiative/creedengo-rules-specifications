Make type sealed.

## Why is this an issue ?

A non-sealed type prevents the JIT compiler from applying strong optimizations such as devirtualization and inlining. If that type is intended to be inheritable then this is expected ; however if it doesn't, then it should be sealed explictly to bring the benefits from those optimizations.

For a more in-depth explanation, see https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance_improvements_in_net_7/#analyzers

### How does the analyzer identify sealable classes ?

The analyzer will consider a type for sealing when the following conditions are met :

* The type is not static, abstract, sealed or special (ie. implicit, script, auto-generated, etc)
* The type is currently not inherited from in the solution
* The type is not public, or it is public and has no overridable member (except for the default ones like GetHashcode, Equals, etc)

### When can it be ignored ?

This rule can be ignored if you want a public type with no overridable member to still be inheritable from other assemblies.

## Non-compliant examples

[source, cs]
----
public class Class1 // Non-compliant if not inherited from, make type sealed
{
    public void Method();
}

public class Class2 // Non-compliant if not inherited from, make type sealed
{
    public sealed void Method(); // The sealed keyword will be removed by the code fix
}

internal class Class3 // Non-compliant if not inherited from because the type is not public, even with a virtual method
{
    public virtual void Method(); // The virtual keyword will be removed by the code fix
}

public class Class4 // Compliant even if not inherited from, the virtual method hints at being overridable from other assemblies
{
    public virtual void Method();
}

public class Class5 : Class4 // Non-compliant if not inherited from, make type sealed
{
    public sealed override void Method(); // The sealed keyword will be removed by the code fix
}

public class Class6 : Class4 // Compliant, Method() is still overridable
{
    public override void Method();
}

## Compliant examples

[source, cs]
----
public sealed class Class1
{
    public void Method();
}

public sealed class Class2
{
    public void Method();
}

internal sealed class Class3
{
    public void Method();
}

public class Class4
{
    public virtual void Method();
}

public sealed class Class5 : Class4
{
    public override void Method();
}

public class Class6 : Class4
{
    public override void Method();
}
